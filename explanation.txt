I implemented the png decoder. React client submits an image and Node.js server analyzes the image and responds with the most frequent pixels.
For now, the decoder works only with particular png images. And for the implementation I refered to tutorial: https://medium.com/achiev/understanding-and-decoding-png-format-example-in-ts-b31fdde1151b
Also, I tried to implement JPEG decoder, and sucessfully decoded all the constituent parts of it, but the complexity of turning the encoded Huffman code
into its decoded DCT counterparts has appeared to me to be beyond the scope of the test task, thus I left it as it is. It is the imageParser.js file
Example of the image, that parses w/o problems is screen.png
